> A curated list of [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) servers, tools, frameworks, and resources.

MCP is an open protocol that lets AI assistants (Claude, GPT, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) connect to local and remote data sources through standardized server implementations.

**This list is curated, not exhaustive, and open to anyone.** Bigger MCP lists exist. The point of this one is that everything on it has been checked. Curated does not mean famous: there is no star or age requirement, and submitting your own server is welcome. Every entry:

- implements MCP for real -- not a README with a `server.json` next to it
- states an open-source licence -- a `LICENSE` file, or a licence field in its package manifest
- was pushed within the last 180 days, and is not archived
- documents how to install and configure it, so someone else can actually run it
- appears exactly once, in one category

Those rules are enforced by [CI](.github/workflows/), not by good intentions: a pull request that breaks the format, adds a dead link, or submits an unlicensed repo fails its checks. A [monthly audit](.github/workflows/health.yml) re-checks every listed repository and files what has rotted.

An MCP server runs as a trusted extension of your assistant, with your files and your credentials. Read the source before you configure one -- a place on this list is a filter, not an audit. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Using a server from this list

Two shapes cover the list. A **stdio** server is one your client starts itself and talks to over stdin and stdout. A **remote** server is hosted by the vendor, so the client needs only the endpoint; those rows carry `Remote` in the Language column.

Two stdio servers, run straight from their published packages:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/allowed/dir"]
    },
    "fetch": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-server-fetch"]
    }
  }
}
```

A remote server. `type` is not optional here: an entry with a `url` and no `type` is read as a stdio server and [skipped by Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp), which reports that the server has a `url` but no `type`.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "example": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.example.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Where that JSON lives, and which extra keys it takes, differs per client -- check your own client's docs. The protocol's [guide to connecting a local server](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/develop/connect-local-servers) walks through the stdio case, and each server's README lists the arguments, tokens and environment variables it expects.

## Contributing

**Anyone can contribute, including your own server.** There is no star requirement and no minimum project age -- if it works, is licensed and is documented, it qualifies. Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the details.

To add a server:

1. Fork the repo and branch off `main`.
2. Add **one** row to the most appropriate existing category, in alphabetical order.
3. Follow the format: `| [Name](URL) | Description | Language |` with the description at 80 characters or fewer.
4. Run `python scripts/validate.py` and fix what it reports.
5. Open a pull request and answer the affiliation question. Submitting your own project is welcome; not disclosing it is not.

Other ways to help, no pull request needed:

- **Report rot.** Dead link, archived upstream, project that no longer speaks MCP -- [open an issue](https://github.com/Sagargupta16/awesome-mcp-servers/issues/new/choose). Pruning is as useful as adding.
- **Fix a description.** Plenty are terser than they should be, or read like marketing.
- **Fill a gap.** Categories with few entries, and the Clients and Tutorials sections, are the thinnest parts of the list.
- **Triage the [health report](https://github.com/Sagargupta16/awesome-mcp-servers/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Amaintenance).** The monthly audit files what broke; confirming or dismissing an item is a real contribution.
